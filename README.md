## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (>= 16.x)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-management-app.git
cd task-management-app
```

2. **Install dependencies**

You can install all dependencies (root, client, and server) with a single command:

```bash
npm run install-all
```

Or install them separately:

```bash
# Root dependencies
npm install

# Server dependencies
cd server
npm install

# Client dependencies
cd ../client
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables**

For the server (.env file in server directory):
```
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/task-management
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
```

For the client (.env.local file in client directory):
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

4. **Start the development servers**

You can start both the client and server from the root directory:

```bash
# Start both client and server concurrently
npm run dev

# Or start them individually
npm run client  # Starts just the client
npm run server  # Starts just the server
```

Or start them separately in different terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1 (Server)
cd server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 (Client)
cd client
npm run dev
```

5. **Access the application**

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Testing the Application

### Admin Workflow
1. Log in as admin
2. Create new tasks with reminder dates
3. Assign tasks to specific users
4. View all tasks in the system
5. Filter tasks by user
6. Manage task assignments

### User Workflow
1. Log in as regular user
2. Receive reminder notifications for approaching tasks
3. View tasks assigned by admin
4. Update task status/priority
5. Delete completed tasks
6. Filter assigned tasks by status/priority

### Testing Reminders
1. Create a task with a reminder date:
   - Set within 1 hour for urgent notification
   - Set within 24 hours for soon notification
   - Set within 72 hours for upcoming notification
2. Log out and log back in to see reminders
3. Refresh the page to verify reminder persistence
4. Complete a task to verify reminder stops
5. Create multiple tasks to test notification grouping

- On page refresh (if logged in)
- Every minute while using the application
- When tasks are updated

### Duplicate Prevention

## Task Assignment Flow

1. **Admin Creates Task**:
   - Admin creates a new task
   - Specifies task details (title, description, etc.)
   - Assigns the task to a specific user

2. **User Manages Assigned Tasks**:
   - User sees tasks assigned to them
   - Can update task status/priority
   - Can delete tasks when completed
